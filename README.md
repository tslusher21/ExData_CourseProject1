# ExData_CourseProject1
Course Project 1 of Exploratory Data Analysis Course

This Repository contains 8 files. 4 r script files to create 4 separate plots, as well as the corresponding png files. The code assumes you have the dataset in your current working directory, and a subdirectory titled "project" where you will store the final results.

All of the instructions for the project, including the location of the dataset and the original charts to be recreated, can be found in the following repository: https://github.com/tslusher21/ExData_Plotting1 (forked from rdpeng)
